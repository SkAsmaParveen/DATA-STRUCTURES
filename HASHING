about instances of various entities such as variable and function names, classes, objects, etc. 

=> Access time of symbol table :
                  Insertion      LOokup Time
Unordered Array : 0(1)           0(n)
Ordered Array :   0(n)           0(logn)
Unordered LL :    0(1)           0(n)
Ordered LL :      0(n)           0(n)
Search Tree :     0(logn)        0(logn)
Hash Table :      0(1)           0(1)
